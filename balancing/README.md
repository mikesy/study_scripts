# Balancing Script

To use the script, ensure you have python3 and numpy.

`python3 balance_tasks_across_subjects <# of subjects> <# of tasks>`

For tasks, you will need some sort of key mapping numbers to variations of your tasks. This will only print out the task count and task array. You will need to add code to save it as a csv or add task names or whatever you may need. 

This just provides a way to balance regardless of how many subjects or tasks you have where random checks typically get stuck.
